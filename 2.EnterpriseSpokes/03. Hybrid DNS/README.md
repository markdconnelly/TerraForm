# GitHub Copilot
I have built most of these things by hands so many times in the portal, so I am going to start off with just using GitHub Copilot to outline the various components I need for my standard design and going from there. 

# Module Components
Most Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings use a Microsoft managed private DNS zone for private network integration. 

To enable failover as designed, the on premise DNS systems are configured to forward these private zones to an Azure private resolver. 
Likewise, Azure is informed of your on premise DNS systems, via a DNS forwarder.
